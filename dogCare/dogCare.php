            <h3>General Dog Care</h3>
            <p> A dog can be a wonderful addition to any home, but whether you're an experienced pet parent or a
                first-time
                adopter, it's important to keep your canine companion's health and happiness a top priority. Below are
                some
            </p>
            <p>
                useful tips for all dog parents.
                And remember: If you're considering bringing home a new dog, please make adoption your first option. We
                encourage you to browse our directory of adoptable dogs in your area or visit our Find a Shelter page to
                start your search.

            <h4>Feeding</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Puppies eight to 12 weeks old need four meals a day.</li>
                <li>Feed puppies three to six months old three meals a day.</li>
                <li>Feed puppies six months to one year two meals a day.</li>
                <li>When your dog reaches his first birthday, one meal a day is usually enough.</li>
                <li>For some dogs, including larger canines or those prone to bloat, it's better to feed two smaller
                    meals.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Premium-quality dry food provides a well-balanced diet for adult dogs and may be mixed with water, broth
                or canned food. Your dog may enjoy cottage cheese, cooked egg or fruits and vegetables, but these
                additions should not total more than ten percent of his daily food intake.
            </p>
            <p>
                Puppies should be fed a high-quality, brand-name puppy food (large breed puppy foods for large breeds).
                Please limit "people food," however, because it can result in vitamin and mineral imbalances, bone and
                teeth problems and may cause very picky eating habits and obesity. Clean, fresh water should be
                available at all times, and be sure to wash food and water dishes frequently.

            <h4>Exercise</h4>
            <p>
                Dogs need exercise to burn calories, stimulate their minds, and stay healthy. Individual exercise needs
                vary based on breed or breed mix, sex, age and level of health. Exercise also tends to help dogs avoid
                boredom, which can lead to destructive behaviors. Supervised fun and games will satisfy many of your
                pet's instinctual urges to dig, herd, chew, retrieve and chase.

            <h4>Grooming</h4>
            <p>
                Help keep your dog clean and reduce shedding with frequent brushing. Check for fleas and ticks daily
                during warm weather. Most dogs don't need to be bathed more than a few times a year. Before bathing,
                comb or cut out all mats from the coat. Carefully rinse all soap out of the coat, or the dirt will stick
                to soap residue. Please visit our Dog Grooming Tips page for more information.

            <h4>Handling</h4>
            <p>
                To carry a puppy or small dog, place one hand under the dog's chest, with either your forearm or other
                hand supporting the hind legs and rump. Never attempt to lift or grab your puppy or small dog by the
                forelegs, tail or back of the neck. If you do have to lift a large dog, lift from the underside,
                supporting his chest with one arm and his rear end with the other.

            <h4>Licensing and Identification</h4>
            <p>
                Follow your community&#39s licensing regulations. Be sure to attach the license to your dog&#39s collar.
                This,
                along with an ID tag and implanted microchip or tattoo, can help secure your dog&#39s return should she
                become lost.

            <h4>Fleas and Ticks</h4>
            <p>
                Daily inspections of your dog for fleas and ticks during the warm seasons are important. Use a flea comb
                to find and remove fleas. There are several new methods of flea and tick control. Speak to your
                veterinarian about these and other options. Visit our Fleas and Ticks page for more information.

            <h4>Medicines and Poisons</h4>
            <p>
                Never give your dog medication that has not been prescribed by a veterinarian. If you suspect that your
                animal has ingested a poisonous substance, call your veterinarian or the <a href=""></a> Animal Poison
                Control
                Center for 24-hour animal poison information at (888) 426- 4435.
